    "From the investor's perspective, we're interested in trying to predict which loans will be paid off on time and which ones won't be. Only the Fully Paid and Charged Off values describe the final outcome of the loan. The other values describe loans that are still on going and where the jury is still out on if the borrower will pay back the loan on time or not. While the Default status resembles the Charged Off status, in Lending Club's eyes, loans that are charged off have essentially no chance of being repaid while default ones have a small chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're interesting in being able to predict which of these 2 values a loan will fall under, we can treat the problem as a binary classification one. Let's remove all the loans that don't contain either Fully Paid and Charged Off as the loan's status and then transform the Fully Paid values to 1 for the positive case and the Charged Off values to 0 for the negative case. While there are a few different ways to transform all of the values in a column, we'll use the Dataframe method replace.:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, one thing we need to keep in mind is the class imbalance between the positive and negative cases. While there are 33,136 loans that have been fully paid off, there are only 5,634 that were charged off. This class imbalance is a common problem in binary classification and during training, the model ends up having a strong bias towards predicting the class with more observations in the training set and will rarely predict the class with less observations. The stronger the imbalance, the more biased the model becomes. "
